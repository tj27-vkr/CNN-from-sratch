# CNN-from-sratch
Convolutional  Neural Network with custom functions

Implementation of CNN with numpy, opencv2.
This code implements a simple (vanilla) convolutional neural network, for classification, containing : convolution, max pooling, fully connected layers. The weights are backpropagated throught two layers, input to convolution and convolution to fully connected output.
The convolution for backpropagation algorithm is taken from scipy.signal.
